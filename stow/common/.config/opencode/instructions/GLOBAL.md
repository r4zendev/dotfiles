Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
If you are not sure about how to use a particular tool - look for documentation online, there is almost certainly a tutorial or guide available for the latest version of the tool.
Please keep the comments during your implementation as minimal as possible. Only add comments if you think it will be helpful for others to understand the code. Otherwise, the code should be self-explanatory.
